# 🧠 Checkmate Live – AI Integrity & llms.txt Policy

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository hosts the public `llms.txt` file for [Checkmate Live](https://www.checkmate.live) — the next-generation esports platform for chess and mind sports.

We believe in a fair future for competitive play and intelligent systems. This file defines how large language models (LLMs), AI agents, and automated tools may interact with our platform. It supports fair play enforcement, agent guidance, trust stack protocols, and detection boundaries powered by our **Sixth-i** anti-cheat and AI evidence system.

ℹ️The `llms.txt` standard was originally proposed by [Jeremy Howard](https://llmstxt.org) and later popularized by [David Dias](https://github.com/diasdavid).

This version has been **adapted and extended by Checkmate Live** for use in online gaming, chess, esports, and real-time AI integrity detection and enforcement — including applications in anti-cheat, telemetry review, and fair play systems.

## 🌐 Foundational Principles

Checkmate Live’s work in AI, esports, and digital rights is guided by a set of foundational principles focused on:

- ⚖️ Ethical use of artificial intelligence  
- 🧠 Human-centered decision-making  
- 🔒 Data privacy and user dignity  
- 🤖 Responsible automation  
- 🎮 Fair play across competitive environments  

Our integrity systems — including Sixth-i — are built to enhance trust, not replace human judgment. These principles are central to how we design, deploy, and refine agent interactions, anti-cheat systems, and AI policy.
