description: Checkmate Live is a next-generation esports platform for chess and mind sports. It combines real-time video battles, collectible-driven arcade play, and competitive tournaments across three core modes: Arcade, Echess, and Pro. Backed by the Asian Chess Federation and developed in partnership with the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII), the platform features Sixth-i AI anti-cheat, blockchain-based Proof of Play rewards, and tokenized participation.
